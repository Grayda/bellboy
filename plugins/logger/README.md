# bellboy-logger
## Provides standardized logging for [Bellboy](http://github.com/Grayda/bellboy)

## Usage
- Consume the plugin, then use the `log` function to log something. Pass it a `type` (e.g. warn, log, debug etc.) to log that.

This plugin will be expanded in the future to show different levels of logging
