# bellboy-demo
## A sample plugin for [Bellboy](http://github.com/Grayda/bellboy)

## Usage
This plugin does nothing useful by default. It's up to you to make a copy and edit accordingly! Because each plugin contains a package.json file, you can save dependencies to it and do anything from output ASCII cats to the logs, to loading bells from a database
